### General Instructions

- Write your descriptions, explanations, and code in an `Rmd` (R markdown) file.
- Name this file as `lab04-first-last.Rmd`, where `first` and `last` are your
first and last names (e.g. `lab04-gaston-sanchez.Rmd`).
- Knit your `Rmd` file as an html document (default option).
- Submit your `Rmd` and `html` files to bCourses, in the corresponding lab assignment.

## 1) Importing Data Tables

Data sets come in many different presentations. One common format is that of a 
data table---like a spreadsheet---although you can find data in other formats 
(especially when the data is in its raw version). However, once you get to the 
analysis stage, you will likely be dealing with some sort of tabular format.

Because data tables are so ubiquitous, it is fundamental that you learn how to
import them in R. In the first part of today's lab, we are going to review 
various aspects that have to do with reading in tables in R.

We will talk about the following functions (and packages)

- `read.table()`
- `read.csv()`
- `read.delim()`
- `read.fwf()`
- Optional: R package `"readr"`



## 2) Flags Data Set

The first data set to consider is the __Flags Data Set__ that is part of the
UCI Machine Learning Repository:

<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Flags>


The location of the data file `flag.data` is:

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.data>


The location of the data dictionary file `flag.names` (i.e. description of the 
data) is:

<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.names>


### 2.1) Your Turn

Use a text editor (e.g. the one in Rstudio) to look at both the `flag.data` 
file, and the code book `flag.names`, and answer the following questions 
(using your own words):

a) What's the character delimiter used in `flag.data`?

comma

b) Is there a row for column names in `flag.data`?
no

c) According to the information of `flag.names` are there any missing values? 
If yes, how are they encoded?
no missing values



### 2.2) Getting a Local Copy of the Data

There are multiple ways to import the tabular data in `flag.data` into R.
One quick-and-dirty way to read this file in R, is by passing the URL location 
of the file directly to any of the `read.table()` functions:

```r
url <- "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.data"
flags <- read.table(url, sep = ",")
```

My suggestion when reading datasets from the Web, is to always try to get a 
local copy of the data file in your machine (as long as you have enough free 
space to save it in your computer). To do this, you can use the function 
`download.file()`, specifying the url address, and the name of the file that 
will be created in your computer. For instance, to save the flags data file 
in __your working directory__, type the following commands on the console:

```r
# (Do NOT include this code in your Rmd file!!!)
# download copy
origin <- 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/flags/flag.data'
destination <- 'flag.data'
download.file(origin, destination)
```

Now that you have a local copy of the dataset, you can import it with 
`read.table()` like so:

```r
# reading data from your working directory
flags <- read.table("flag.data", sep = ",")
```

Once you read a data table, you may want to start looking at its contents,
usually taking a peek at a few rows. This can be done with `head()` and/or 
with `tail()`:

```r
# take a peek of first rows
head(flags)

# take a peek of last rows
tail(flags)
```

Likewise, you may also want to examine how R has decided to take care of the
storage details (what data type is used for each column?). Use the function
`str()` to check the structure of the data frame:

```r
# check data frame's structure
str(flags, vec.len = 1)
```

Two things to notice are:

- the way R gives names to the columns (e.g. `"V1"`, `"V2"`, etc)

- the data-type R uses for each column (e.g. `"character"`,
`"integer"`, etc)

In general, the reading table functions have several mechanisms to make an 
educated guess for how it should handle various details such as column names, 
data types, missing values, etc. However, you can always play with the arguments
of `read.table()` and friends to have more control over the data importing 
behavior of R.



### 2.3) Your Turn: Column Names

So far we have been able to read the data file in R. But we are missing a few 
things such as the names for the columns.

a) Use the combine function `c()` to create a character vector `column_names` 
with the names of each column. Use the variable names displayed in section 
"7. Attribute Information" of the `flag.names` file:

    + `name`
    + `landmass`
    + `zone`
    + `area`
    + `population`
    + _etc_

BTW: Here's a simple example using `c()` to create a character vector: 
`x = c('one', 'two', 'three')`

```{r}
# your code
column_names = c('name', 'landmass', 'zone', 'area', 'population', 'language', 'religion', 'bars', 'stripes', 'colours', 'red', 'green', 'blue', 'gold', 'white', 'black', 'orange', 'mainhue', 'circles', 'crosses', 'saltires', 'quarters', 'sunstars', 'crescent', 'triangle', 'icon', 'animate', 'text', 'topleft', 'botright')


```


b) Use your vector `column_names` and pass this to the argument `col.names` in
the following call to `read.table()`. Also, change the evaluation option of the 
code chunk to `eval = TRUE`, so that when you knit the file, R runs the command.

```{r}
# import with read.table()
flags <- read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep =  ",", 
  col.names = column_names)
```


c) Once the data is imported, inspect the columns names of `flags` with either
the function `names()` or the function `colnames()`

```{r}
names(flags)

```



### 2.4) Your Turn: Importing a few rows

a) Look at the documentation of the function `read.table()` and find how to 
use its argument `nrows` in order to read just the first 5 lines in `flag.data`. 
Name this data as `flag_1_5`, and display its content.

```{r}
flag_1_5 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep =  ",", 
  nrows = 5, col.names = column_names)

flag_1_5
```


b) Look at the documentation of the function `read.table()` and find how to 
use its arguments `skip` and `nrows` in order to skip the first 5 lines in 
`flag.data`, and then read the next 5 lines (lines 6-10). Name this data as 
`flag_6_10`, and display its content.

```{r}
# your code

flag_6_10 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep =  ",", skip = 5,
  nrows = 5, col.names = column_names)

flag_6_10

```



### 2.5) Your Turn: Importing a few columns

a) Look at the documentation of the function `read.table()` and find how to 
use its `colClasses` argument in order to import just the first four columns of 
`flag.data`. Name this data as `flag4`, and check its structure with `str()`.
_Hint_: the repetition function `rep()` can be your friend.

```{r}
column_names[1:5]
```


```{r}
cc <- rep('NULL', 30)      
cc[c(2, 3, 4)] <- 'integer'    
cc[c(1)] <- 'character' 


flag4 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep =  ",", colClasses = cc, col.names = column_names)

flag4

```


b) How would you import the first, the third, and the fifth columns of 
`flag.data`. Name this data as `flag135`, and check its structure with `str()`.
_Hint_: the repetition function `rep()` can be your friend.

```{r}
cc <- rep('NULL', 30)      
cc[c(3, 5)] <- 'integer'    
cc[c(1)] <- 'character' 


flag135 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep =  ",", colClasses = cc, col.names = column_names)

flag135

```

## 3) Columns of Categorical Variables

As you can tell from the contents of `flag.data`, most of the data values are 
numbers. Moreover, if you read the descriptions in `flag.names`, most of the
variables are categorical (i.e. qualitative) but have been numerically encoded.
For example, the second column `landmass` is numerically encoded with six 
categories:

- `1 = N.America`
- `2 = S.America` 
- `3 = Europe`
- `4 = Africa` 
- `5 = Asia`  (there is actually a typo in `flag.names`)
- `6 = Oceania`

Often, we may be interested in having categorical variables with their actual 
text descriptions instead of their numerical codes.

Here's an example for how to import a subset `flag.data` with just the first
four columns, and then re-encode the values of `landmass` to change them from 
their numeric values to text categories.

The next code chunk imports the first four columns:

```{r}
flags4 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep = ",",
  col.names = c("name", "landmass", "area", "population", rep("", 26)),
  colClasses = c(
    "character", # name
    "integer",   # landmass
    "integer",   # area
    "integer",   # population
    rep("NULL", 26))  # exclude rest of columns
)
```

Now the interesting step. We create an auxiliary vector `landmass_keys` that
contains the actual numeric values, and also the text descriptions which are
used as names. You can basically think of this vector as a set of __key-value__
pairs in which a given _key_ refers to the category, e.g. `N.America`, and the 
associated _value_ corresponds to the number in the data file, e.g. `1`

```{r}
# auxiliary numeric vector with 
landmass_keys = c(
  "N.America" = 1,
  "S.America" = 2,
  "Europe" = 3,
  "Africa" = 4,
  "Asia" = 5,
  "Oceania" = 6)

landmass_keys
```

Now that we have `landmass_keys`, we can use it to find the text-category
of any set of numbers between 1 and 6. Here's a toy example for how to do this.

```{r}
# small test
landmass_keys[c(2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3)]
```

We haven't discussed R vectors yet. But we are essentially working with 
a vector `landmass_keys` and another vector `c(2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3)`. The 
output of the preceding command returns another named numeric vector. What
do we want from this output? What we really want is the names of the vector:

```{r}
# we are interested in the names
names(landmass_keys[c(2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3)])
```

Instead of using the test-vector `c(2, 1, 5, 6, 4, 3)`, we have to use the
`landmass` values. One way to extract or inspect these values is with the 
dollar sign `$`

```{r}
head(flags4$landmass)
```

Putting everything together, we use `landmass_keys` to produce a vector
with the land numbers and their actual text categories. Because we care only 
about the text, we extract them with the `names()` function as follows:

```{r}
landmass_categories = names(landmass_keys[flags4$landmass])
head(landmass_categories)
```

The final step involves replacing the data of column `landmass` with this
command:

```{r}
# replace data in column landmass
# (now landmass have character values, not numeric)
flags4$landmass = landmass_categories
head(flags4)
```



### 3.1) Your Turn: Language Categories 

Import only the first six columns (i.e. `name`, `landmass`, ..., `language`). 
Repeat the process explained in the previous section 3 in order to replace the
numeric values of `language` with their text categories. Display the `table()` 
of counts for column `language`.

```{r}
flags6 = read.table(
  file = "flag.data", 
  sep = ",",
  col.names = column_names,
  colClasses = c(
    "character", # name
    "integer",   # landmass
    "integer",   # area
    "integer",   # population
    "integer",
    "integer",
    rep("NULL", 24))  # exclude rest of columns
)

language_keys = c(
  "English" = 1, "Spanish" = 2, "French" = 3, "German" = 4, "Slavic" = 5, "Other Indo-European" = 6, "Chinese" = 7, "Arabic" = 8, 
               "Japanese/Turkish/Finnish/Magyar" = 9, "Others" = 10)

language_categories = names(language_keys[flags6$language])
flags6$language = language_categories

flags6
```

## 4) More `"dplyr"`

This part of the lab involves working with the __pipe operator__, denoted as `%>%`
and also as `|>`, which allows you write function calls in a more human-readable 
way. This operator is heavily used among the ecosystem of `"tidyverse"` 
packages, and it's becoming less uncommon in traditional R code.

The behavior of `"dplyr"` is functional in the sense that function calls don't 
have side-effects. This implies that you must always save their results in order 
to keep them in an object (in memory). 

The "ugly" side of this functional behavior is that it doesn't lead to 
particularly elegant code, especially if you want to do many operations at once.
For example, refer to the table `flags4`. Say you want to calculate the averages
of `area`, and `population`, grouping by `landmass`, and arranging by area. You
either have to do it step-by-step:

```{r}
# manipulation step-by-step
dat1 <- group_by(flags4, landmass)
dat2 <- select(dat1, landmass, area, population)
dat3 <- summarise(dat2,
  avg_area = mean(area, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_pop = mean(population, na.rm = TRUE))
dat4 <- arrange(dat3, avg_area)
dat4
```

Or if you don't want to name the intermediate results, you need to wrap the 
function calls inside each other:

```{r}
# inside-out style (hard to read)
arrange(
  summarise(
    select(
      group_by(flags4, landmass),
      landmass, area, population
    ),
    avg_area = mean(area, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_pop = mean(population, na.rm = TRUE)
  ),
  avg_area
)
```

This is difficult to read because the order of the operations is from inside 
to out. Thus, the arguments are a long way away from the function. 
To get around this problem, `"dplyr"` provides the `%>%` operator from 
`"magrittr"`.

`x %>% f(y)` turns into `f(x, y)` so you can use it to rewrite multiple 
operations that you can read left-to-right, top-to-bottom:

```{r}
# using %>%
flags4 %>% 
  group_by(landmass) %>%
  select(landmass, area, population) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_area = mean(area, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_pop = mean(population, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(avg_area)
```


### 3.1) Your Turn: 

Use `"dplyr"` functions and the _magrittr_ (aka _pipe_) operator `"%>%"` to 
perform the following operations on the table `flags` (the one with ALL the
columns):

a) slice the table `flags` to get the first 3 rows, selecting columns `name`,
`landmass`, and `population`

```{r}
flags %>% 
  head(3) %>%
  select(name, landmass, population)

```


b) slice the table `flags` to get the first 5 rows, selecting columns 
`name`, `landmass`, `area`, `population`, arranging rows by `population`

```{r}
flags %>% 
  head(5) %>%
  select(name, landmass, area, population)%>%
  arrange(population)

```


c) create a data frame `flags_circles` by filtering the data with flags 
containing one or more circles, and selecting columns `name`, `religion`, 
`circles`. Display its structure with `str()`

```{r}
flags %>% 
  filter(circles > 0) %>%
  select(name, religion)%>%
  str()

```


d) create a data frame `flags_crosses` by filtering the data with those 
flags containing one or more crosses, selecting columns `name`, `colours`,
`religion`, (in that order).

```{r}
flags_crosses = flags %>% 
  filter(crosses > 0) %>%
  select(name, colours, religion)
 
flags_crosses
```


e) Filter those flags that have sunstars, and obtain the count (i.e. the
frequency) of `mainhue` (e.g. number of flags with red main hue, number of
flags with green main hue, etc), arranging values by this count in descending
order.

```{r}
# your code
flags %>% 
  filter(sunstars > 0) %>%
  group_by(mainhue) %>%
  summarise(mainhue = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(mainhue))
```


f) Compute the median `area`, and median `population` of those countries
with languages _Spanish_ or _French_, grouped by `landmass`.



```{r}
# your code

flags6$landmass = landmass_categories
flags6 %>% 
  filter(language == 'Spanish' | language == 'French')%>%
  group_by(landmass) %>%
  summarise(med_area = median(area, na.rm = TRUE),
    med_pop = median(population, na.rm = TRUE)) 
  
 


```
